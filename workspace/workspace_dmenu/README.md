# workspace_dmenu

This is a simple script to open class workspaces through [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).  
You should supply the file ``.classes`` with class directory names separated by newlines in your ``SCHOOL_DIR`` directory.

# TODO and ideas
- [ ] make ``.classes`` file mandatory for all tools?
    - [ ] or scan ``SCHOOL_DIR`` subdirectories for ``.workspace`` files?
