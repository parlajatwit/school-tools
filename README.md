# school-tools

The purpose of this repository is to hold tools I am writing to make my school workflow better. Many tools are subject to change, but I would like the overarching idea to be a unix-style set of tools, where every tool does one thing well and they interoperate with ease. We'll see how well this is accomplished with time :)  
  
## Usage
This suite of tools assumes a common "school" directory exists, with "classes" as subdirectories.  
The directory structure should be as follows:
```
school
├── datasci
├── ethics
├── os
├── security
└── sysadmin
```  
The environment variable ``SCHOOL_DIR`` should be the absolute path to this school directory.
